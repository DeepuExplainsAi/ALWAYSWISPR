Speak in Hinglish, Hindi, English or 25+ languages, and Wispr types it into **any app**, over **any keyboard**.
Open source under the **Apache License 2.0**. Copyright 2026 Deepu Gupta.

- **Bubble over every keyboard.** Tap the orange orb, talk, tap ✓. Text is typed where your cursor is (✕ cancels).
- **Never deletes your notes.** Wispr only *adds* text. It never replaces what's already in Notes, Keep, Docs or Word.
- **Hold the bubble: mini window.** Write / Polish / Translate, target language, Hindi ⇄ Hinglish, AI models, **AI chat**, **Understand screen**.
- **Understand any screen in one tap.** Reads the text on screen in any language and explains or translates it. **Scan picture (OCR)** reads text inside images, videos and PDFs (Android 11+). Works from any app via Android's Accessibility button/shortcut.
- **AI chat anywhere.** Type or speak; tap **Insert** to drop the answer into the box you were in.
- **Hinglish by default.** Hindi toggle OFF = always Roman Hinglish ("kal meeting hai"). ON = Devanagari.
- **Your own free Groq key.** Stored with Android Keystore (AES-256-GCM). No Wispr server, no account, no tracking.

| Use | Model | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Speech | `whisper-large-v3` (default), `whisper-large-v3-turbo` | 20 req/min, 2,000/day, 8 h audio/day |
| Polish / translate / chat | `openai/gpt-oss-120b` (default), `openai/gpt-oss-20b` | 30 req/min, 1,000/day |
| Chat + screen OCR (vision) | `qwen/qwen3.8-27b`, `qwen/qwen3.6-27b` | Preview |
| Chat with live web search | `groq/compound`, `groq/compound-mini` | 250/day |

"Check what's live on Groq" in the mini window's **Models** tab lists every model your key can use, including new ones. Add a model permanently with one line in `Models.kt`.

## Requirements

- Android **8.0 (API 26)** or newer. OCR screen scan needs Android 11+.
- Build: AGP 9.4.0, Gradle 9.6.0, JDK 21, compileSdk/targetSdk **37**, Kotlin 2.4.10 (built into AGP 9).

## Build and release (GitHub Actions)

1. **Signing key, once** (required for releases, so phones can update in place):
   ```
   keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore wispr.jks -alias wispr -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10000
   base64 -w0 wispr.jks > wispr.jks.b64
   ```
   In GitHub: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** add `WISPR_KEYSTORE_BASE64` (contents of `wispr.jks.b64`), `WISPR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `WISPR_KEY_ALIAS` (`wispr`), `WISPR_KEY_PASSWORD`. Back up `wispr.jks` safely: lose it and nobody can update again.
2. **Release**: bump `wispr.version` in `gradle.properties`, write `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, then `git tag v4.1.0 && git push origin v4.1.0`. The signed APK + `SHA256SUMS.txt` land on the **Releases** page. Tags with a dash (`v4.2.0-beta.1`) become pre-releases.
3. Test build without releasing: **Actions → Build APK and publish release → Run workflow** (APK under *Artifacts*).

## In-app updates

Every installed Wispr checks this repo's latest GitHub Release (app open: every 6 h, keyboard bubble: every 12 h, with ETag caching and a fallback when GitHub's 60 requests/hour limit is hit). When a newer tag is out:

- The app shows an **update card** with the release notes and **Update now**; outside the app a notification appears.
- **Auto** (default): it downloads on Wi-Fi, checks the SHA-256 and that the APK is the same app signed with the same key, then one tap installs it. On Android 12+ it installs without the extra Android prompt; Android 8 to 11 show the normal "Update" dialog. Settings and the Groq key stay.
- First time only, Android asks to allow **Install unknown apps** for Wispr.
- If an APK is signed with a different key (for example an old debug-signed build), Wispr says so and opens the GitHub page: uninstall once, install the new APK, and from then on updates work in-app.
- The repo is baked in from `github.repository` at build time, so forks check their own Releases. Local builds: set `wispr.repo=owner/name` in `gradle.properties`.
- **Google Play build**: set `wispr.selfUpdate=false` and remove `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` and `UPDATE_PACKAGES_WITHOUT_USER_ACTION` from the manifest (Play doesn't allow self-updating apps).
- Android developer verification: as of 30 Sep 2026 it's enforced only for 7 app stores in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand; direct GitHub APKs aren't covered yet. Google plans a global rollout in 2027, so register the package in the Android Developer Console before then.

## Privacy

- Update checks only ask GitHub for this repo's latest release (no personal data, no key). Turn them off in Settings → Updates.

Audio, and screen text when **you** tap Understand, go only to Groq over HTTPS, using your key. Wispr never reads what you type, and it never sends your data on its own.
